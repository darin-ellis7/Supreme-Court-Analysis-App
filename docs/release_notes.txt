SCOTUSAPP 2.1 Improvements (1/18/2019):
	- author, URL, and keywords now added to the CSV
	- CSV encoding now correct for viewing in Excel (no more weird characters)
	- The script now attempts to get the full titles of articles whose titles are truncated in the RSS feed with "..."
	- large downloads are now stable
	- scrapers written for Politico and The Hill + minor maintenance for the rest
	- "fallback" for source-specific scrapers - if they fail, the script then attempts to scrape with the generic, Newspaper-powered scraper
	- mechanism to keep track of Google Cloud API Requests should be more accurate
